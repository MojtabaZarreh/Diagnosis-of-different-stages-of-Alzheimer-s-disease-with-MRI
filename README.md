# Alzheimer Detection with Deep Learning

Project Description

This project aims to detect and classify Alzheimer's disease using MRI brain images. The OASIS dataset has been utilized, and deep learning models are implemented using PyTorch.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that develops in multiple stages:

Early Stage: Mild memory loss and minor cognitive issues.

Middle Stage: More noticeable problems in learning, problem-solving, and communication.

Advanced Stage: Severe cognitive decline and inability to perform daily tasks.

The goal of this project is to classify MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's to enable early and precise diagnosis.
